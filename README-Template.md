# Project Title

Trading App with websockets 

## Description

This app uses websockets to display in real time with a graph the value of currencies. I am adding my personal key fron Finnhub, which you can use. Only one client can be connected at the same time for security reasons. 

I have added just a few currencies, the project can be expanded to include more in the future.

## Getting Started

Cd into the main folder and run npm start to start the Node server. Then, cd into client and do npm start to start the React client.

## Built With

React, Node, socket.io, Recharts.
